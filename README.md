Overview of things fun to work further on

Analysis of CRISPR screen data (counts)
experimental design: time (T=0, T=late), treatment (yes/no at T=late), cell line (one neg cont, one pos control, 3 others)
main effects (time, treatment, cell line) as well as interactions (esp. treatment and time) are relevant
ShrinkBayes could be used as basis, but Pi0 needs to be allowed to change

Integrating CRISPR screen data (counts) with RNA-seq data
ellaborate on this still - what gene sets are relevant here, besides pathways?
